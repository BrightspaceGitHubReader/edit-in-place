Essential components - 

depend on https://github.com/BrightspaceUI/core for buttons, labels, styles, input



properties - default text - display this italically when no text has populated the component. This should also be the default empty text.
text - display this if it exists.
state - Whether it is open for edit or not
language - for Save and Cancel

create a textchanged event to send up when Save is pressed and the new text and old text are different.


Plan: 
Follow the pattern we've already worked on for the Course link, but make it dynamic.

Display the template that correctly displays what's necessary.

 - No elements should move as a result of the switch between input and label. therefore the element should margin out the necessary 
	length for the ENTIRE content to fit.
	How do we achieve this requirement?

Design questions for others:	
 - Define the size immediately on load?
 - If the content is hidden will it definitely fit correctly?
 - Do we allow for infinite text or truncate as necessary?
